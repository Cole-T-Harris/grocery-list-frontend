# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a grocery list web application that sends API requests to a fastAPI backend ([FastAPI Repo](https://github.com/Cole-T-Harris/fastapi-pw-api)).

## Getting Started

1. Ensure fastApi backend is running properly at http://localhost:8000.
2. If not running at http://localhost:8000, add an.env file to the directory and set a variable called `REACT_APP_SERVER_URL` equal to the url that the server is running at.
3. Run `npm run dev` to run in development mode
